		# 4th August 2022
		Today we will re-import the pornographic blacklist from Porn
		Records and add it back into [My Privacy DNS][mpd] as a
		consequence it haven't been very popular to keep the PR issues
		in a closed section, where login was required, to ensure My
		Privacy DNS didn't participated in spreading Adult NSFW material.

		Related Issues can be found here:

1.0.0
		Moved the `./source.list` to `./source/source.list`

		Removed all adult only contents to https://mypdns.org/my-privacy-dns/porn-records

		Just some clean up after the years have gone by.
