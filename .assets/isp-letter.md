Dear [Department Name Here],

I am Rexadev from MyPDNS project.
Would you be interested in our subproject named "porn-records"[1], which
is an Anti-porn listing project? We know about many domains which
Cloudflare's "Family Safety"[2] Adult-filtering DNS failed to filter.

Every record is reviewed by maintainers and discussed with proof such as
screenshots.  
Our blocklist has domains other projects miss with 0 false positives.
We do not import from other sources therefore the rate of false-positive is extremely low.

We do believe we can help each other by using and collaborating on this
data.  
Please do not hesitate to reply to us.
