# Bait sites
A bait site is a site that provide contents only designed to drag you in for 
then harvesting all of your information, by usage of Track-Ware, Malicious Code 
and other forms of Spy-Ware ex. bypassing your DNS settings with DoT...

Just like fake news are posting a lot of "news" to get better search ranking 
for turning you into data collected zombie money.

I have never seen a such list/DB/RPZ that targets these companies like Google, 
Microsoft and Facebook who doesn't provide anything to you, but only takes from 
you for then letting other paying to them in hope of a successful manipulation 
of the choices you make.

We may never reverse the order of "it is the costumer who rules" and into this 
wild west web, where it have turned into the oppose through brainwashing 
banners, search result and articles based on data collected on everybody.

This list should the have those bad guys to be blocked and should not be 
( I know the real world sob ) in a default list, but a optional list for those 
who choose to..
