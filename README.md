# The matrix

This repository is www.mypdns.org self maintained list of domains that 
needs to be blocked for various reasons.

# Source list
The `source` folder contains several sub-folders, each named as groups, 
for which a submission should be put. This however doesn't necessary 
mean that one domain can't be put into several 'groups'

E.g. `google.*` which belongs to several groups as they represents all 
online evil when we talks privacy and anti brainwash/manipulation; 
Facebook is also well represented in several categories.

# Categorising
Each sub-folder of `sources` should contain it's own README which in 
short describe what the list is all about and criteria to add a domain 
into it's `domain.list` or `wildcard.list`

# Whitelist
This list have it's very own life, as this is a very very tricky one to 
maintain.

The reason for that is, it have to balance between what is going on with 
a domain that for several reasons might be blacklisted on some lists 
but not on others. It can also be that a domain in general do 99,9% 
right, but because of it's nature of user based submissions, could do a 
lot of evil.

E.g. Gitlab
Gitlab is 100% user submitted contents, but for the same reason also a 
widely target from bad guys to host there evil code. For that rightfully 
reason Gitlab often pop ups on list for malicious code. But as that 
would have huge influence on our workflow, it's of curse have to be 
whitelisted.
