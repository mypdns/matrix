# Donate to My Privacy DNS

My Privacy DNS is an excellent way to protect your privacy online, and it also
 offers additional features to help you stay safe and secure. One of these
 features is the anti-porn list, which blocks access to pornographic and
 explicit sites.
This feature is especially useful for parents who want to ensure that their
 children are not exposed to inappropriate content online.

With the rise of online tracking and data breaches, it's become more important
than ever to take steps to protect your privacy online.
My Privacy DNS is a great way to do just that. It's easy to use, highly
 effective, and completely free.

By donating to My Privacy DNS, you are not only supporting a great project
 that helps protect your privacy online, but you are also helping to ensure
 that it continues to provide this valuable service free of charge to the public.
 Additionally, you are supporting the development of other privacy-friendly software.
That's why I'm donating to My Privacy DNS, and I encourage you to do the same.
Together, we can help protect our privacy and keep the internet safe and secure for everyone.
